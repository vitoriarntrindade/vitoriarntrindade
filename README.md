# About Me

Hello little grasshoppers,

I am **Vit√≥ria**, a **Junior Backend Developer** focused on **Python**.

I have been transitioning careers since 2023. Previously, I worked as a quality monitor, where I had the opportunity to participate in highly collaborative teams inspired by agile methodologies.

My learning journey includes courses in system project creation, covering everything from requirements gathering to project feasibility analysis. I also delved into DevOps culture and agile methodologies at FIAP, in addition to participating in various programming courses and bootcamps.
